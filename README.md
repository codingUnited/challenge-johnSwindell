# ✅ Challenge 1 Completed – Easy Mode

Welcome! This repo contains my submission for **Challenge 1** of the Coding United Club Challenges.

## 🟦 Challenge 1: GitHub Repo Setup & “Ready to Code” Page

### What I Did:
- ✅ Created a public repo under the `codingUnited` GitHub  
- ✅ Named it using the correct format: `challenge-johnSwindell`  
- ✅ Added the folder: `challenge1-GithubRepoCreation`  
- ✅ Inside that folder, I included an `index.html` file with the message:  
  ```html
  <h1>Ready to Code!</h1>

### Best of luck, and remember to reach out if you need help!
